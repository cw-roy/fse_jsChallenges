# __New assignment for week 12:  Dice Roller__:heavy_check_mark

## Activity: A Dice Roller

## Items for completion

__The user should be able to tell you how many dice they want to roll:__ :heavy_check_mark

- __HTML Task:__ Create a [text input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text). :heavy_check_mark

__The user should be able to tell you when they are ready to roll the dice:__ :heavy_check_mark

- __HTML Task:__ Create a "Roll!" [button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button). :heavy_check_mark

__The user should see the total of all the dice that were rolled:__  :heavy_check_mark

- __HTML Task:__ Create a "Total" element on the page. :heavy_check_mark

__The user should be able to tell you when they are ready to see the roll of every die individually (in addition to the Total):__  :heavy_check_mark

__The user should see the result of every individual die on the page (in addition to the Total):__  :heavy_check_mark

- __HTML Task:__ Create an "All Rolls" element on the page. :heavy_check_mark

### 3. On user request, roll those dice and show the total to the user  :heavy_check_mark

### 4. On user request, show all of the individual die rolls to the user (4 points) :heavy_check_mark

### Extra Credit

- Create a reset button which, on click, will empty the array and the `innerHTML` of your Total and All Rolls elements.  :heavy_check_mark

- Create a user input box, where a user can specify the number of sides on the dice. For example, instead of six-sided dice, the user could opt for a 20-sided die.  :heavy_check_mark

- Make each "dice roll" element look more like an actual six-sided (cube) die. You don't have to show dice pips â€“ numbers are fine. Just find some ways to style these "dice" elements to help the user "see" them as dice.

## (Assignments from week 11 - completed) JavaScript Basics Practice Exercises :heavy_check_mark

This will help you practice with variables, conditionals, built-in functions and arrays. Fork and clone the following starter repo and get started solving some problems with JavaScript!

*Starter Repo: <https://github.com/erics273/js_challenges_starter>*

## Coin Flip :heavy_check_mark

Create a script that has a random chance of printing out heads or tails.

## The Tallest Mountain :heavy_check_mark

Create an array that contains a bunch of numbers representing the heights of various mountains. Write some code that identifies the height of the tallest of the available mountains and prints it out.

## Hangman Lite :heavy_check_mark

Create a variable called word that contains a hangman word, and create a second variable called letter that indicates the letter that the player guessed. Print out "Yeah, the letter x exists y times in my word" if the letter exists (but substitute the actual letter and the number of times). If the letter doesn't exist, print out "Nope, that letter doesn't exist in my word."

## Change Machine :heavy_check_mark

Imagine we have a very versatile change machine. Create a variable called amount stores a quantity of dollars, and write some code that produces an array that indicates the number of 1, 5, 10, and 20 bills that the change machine should return. You want the change machine to return the smallest number of bills possible.  After your code runs you should have a new array of the format [twenties, tens, fives, ones]. For example, if amount = 47, you should print an array after your code runs that looks like [2, 0, 1, 2] (two twenties, 0 tens, 1 five, 2 ones).

## Finding Palindromes :heavy_check_mark

Create a variable called word that stores a word we want to test as a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). Write some code that prints out "true" if word is a palindrome, or "false" if its not.
